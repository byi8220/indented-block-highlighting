## Known Issues

**Improper indentation levels for lines with mixed whitespace:**

Indenting the **same** line with a mixture of tabs and spaces causes improper behavior because of how VSC autoadjusts whitespace

Example of issue:
![Autoindent issue](whitespace-issue.png "Improper mixed whitespace issue.")

This extension does not parse syntax, it simply checks indentation levels.

Unindented text is not highlighted; This is intentional.
